✅ FINAL POLISH PROMPT — PASTE INTO REPLIT

I want you to complete all final UX and polish tasks in one pass.
Follow these instructions carefully and apply every fix exactly as written.

1️⃣ End-of-Path Completion Screen

When the user finishes the last lesson in ANY path:

Replace “Next Step” with “Completed!”

Show the raised-hands mascot (Zayd celebrating)

Style the screen with the same gold/blue gradient theme

Add a small 🎉 or 🌙 confetti effect (no animation library needed, simple emojis fade-in)

Make sure the correct mascot asset is used.

2️⃣ Boss Level — Fix Blank Enemy Score

In the Boss Level results screen:

The boss/enemy score shows blank — FIX IT.

Ensure BOTH scores appear:

User Score

Boss Score

Style both scores to match the theme.

3️⃣ Countdown Animation Fix (Zayd Offset Bug)

The 3-2-1 countdown currently:

Spins incorrectly

Ends offset to the side

Replace animation with:

Zayd remains centered

No rotation

Simple scale-in (e.g. scale 0.8 → 1.1 → 1.0)

Smooth fade-in/out for each number

Ensure Zayd resets position perfectly after the animation.

4️⃣ Streak Freeze Purchase UI Cleanup

In PurchaseStreakFreezeModal:

Fix spacing

Fix padding

Align text

Ensure buttons are evenly spaced

Make modal use the blue/gold theme, NOT grey

5️⃣ Remove ALL Grey Popups System-Wide

Search the entire project and ensure:

No popup/modal/card uses grey or default browser background.

ALL popups use the app’s style:

background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1a3a52 0%, #0B1E2D 100%);
border: 2px solid rgba(212, 175, 55, 0.3);


Apply this consistently to ALL modals:

MiniProfileModal

QuickMessageModal

ErrorBoundary fallback

Confirmation Modals

Any leftover default dialogs

Everything must fully match theme.

6️⃣ Add ﷺ ONLY After Prophet Muhammad

Search the entire app for occurrences of:

“Prophet Muhammad”

“Muhammad (saw)”

“Muhammad saw”

“Muhammad pbuh”

Modify only when the name refers to Prophet Muhammad, and change to:

Prophet Muhammad ﷺ


DO NOT add ﷺ to:

Other prophets

User names

Lesson titles that refer to “Muhammad” not meaning the Prophet

Any place where it is clearly not the Prophet

Make sure the font renders correctly inside JSX.

7️⃣ Friends & Global Events: Fix Global Icon

On the “Global Events” page:

The first tab shows the correct globe icon

But the SECOND PAGE still shows a white circle

Fix the reference so BOTH use the same lucide-react Globe icon.

8️⃣ General Alignment Fixes

Align friend names consistently

Fix spacing on request badges

Ensure nothing jumps, shifts, or clips on iPhone width

All lists should be left-aligned except ranks/icons

9️⃣ Verify Avatar Consistency

Now that the key extraction is fixed, confirm:

The selected user avatar appears correctly everywhere

MiniProfileModal uses correct avatar

Leaderboard uses correct avatar

No randomization

No fallback triggering unless avatar is invalid

If any component still uses a wrong path, convert it to:

getAvatarImage(avatarKey, { userId, nickname })

🔟 Do a FULL sweep to ensure no leftover bugs

After all changes:

Rebuild

Ensure no console warnings

Ensure no broken images

Ensure no unstyled modals

Ensure no leftover “Next Step” phrasing

Ensure Boss Level results show BOTH scores

Ensure countdown looks smooth and centered

📌 Apply ALL fixes in one single pass.

When done, provide a summary of every file modified.

🚨 IMPORTANT: Do NOT change anything outside the tasks below.
🚨 No theme changes, no styling changes, no refactoring, no extra files, no renaming, no reorganising.

Remove “Better luck next time!” entirely.

Replace with: “Keep going! You’re improving every time!”

Remove emojis on this line.

Replace losing mascot with avatar_man_lantern.

Ramadan Message

Ramadan message must NOT show outside Ramadan.

Outside Ramadan show: “Launching Ramadan 2026!”

Use our rocket mascot image (not emoji).

Countdown Locks

Any page with a countdown must be fully locked until countdown ends:

No taps

No navigation

No swiping

No modals

Lesson Navigation Bug

Fix avatar jumping to bottom after the first 3 free lessons.

After finishing a lesson:

Otherwise go to next lesson normally.

Challenge Limits

User can challenge unlimited different friends.

But only 1 active challenge per friend at a time.

Boss Level Answer Logic

Only for Boss Level quizzes:

Wrong answers must not be short/obvious.

Make all answers similar length/structure.

Avoid Repeated Questions

Apply to Boss Level, Friend Challenges, and all non-Learning-Path quizzes.

Do not repeat until all available questions are used.

Notifications

Show red notification dot on Friends icon in bottom nav.

Count = total unread notifications.

Inside Friends page:

Clicking a notification marks it as read

Reduces count

Disappears when all read

This used to work; logic may have broken. Check previous system first.

Exit Challenge Confirmation

When exiting mid-challenge, show modal:
“Are you sure you want to exit? Your challenge attempt will be lost.”
Buttons: Cancel / Exit.

Challenge Mascots

Ensure mascots for Friend Challenge, Global Events, and Boss Challenge are consistent and correctly assigned.

Remove Duplicate Quiz Indicator

In Learning Path quizzes, remove the top-left “Question X of Y” element entirely.

🚨 Final Reminder:
Do NOT change anything outside the items above.
No theme edits, no UI redesigns, no layout shifts, no refactoring, no renaming, no folder changes.
Only perform exactly what is written.

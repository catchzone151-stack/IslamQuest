ANGELS PATH UPDATE + UNIVERSAL LESSSON LOCKING + FULL XP/COIN/STREAK INTEGRATION

1️⃣ Change the Angels Path

Rename the learning path currently “Angels & Jinn” to “Angels” only.

Remove ALL references to Jinn in names, files, lessons, UI, headings, and data.

Keep ONLY the angels lessons we mapped (all known angels from Qur’an + Sahih hadith, including the “no four-finger space except an angel” hadith lesson).



---

2️⃣ Lock All Lessons Except Lesson 1 in Every Path

Apply to all 14 learning paths:

Lesson 1 = unlocked.

All later lessons = locked until the previous lesson is completed + quiz passed + rewards given.

Locked lessons must show:

subtle grey overlay

small lock icon

clear lesson number still visible


When a lesson unlocks, animate with a small gold pulse.

3️⃣ Ensure All Lessons Fully Use the XP / Coin / Streak System

Everything in every learning path must correctly trigger and reflect our reward system:

XP

Award the correct XP amounts exactly as already defined.

XP must instantly update everywhere: Home header, Profile, Friends list, Level system, Leaderboard, Challenges, Global events.


Coins

Award coins exactly as per our existing coin rules.

4️⃣ Do NOT Change Anything Else

No changes to lesson text, quiz content, UI theme, animations, layout, mascots, or any other learning path.

Do NOT modify the challenge system, friends system, global events, boss levels, or revision system.

Only apply:

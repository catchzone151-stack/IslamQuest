Apply the following final Phase 6 fixes:

1. Challenges Unlock Logic

Remove ALL lesson-based restrictions from Challenge.jsx:

Delete any checks involving:

completed lessons

shared lessons

comparing progress

sharedLessonsCount

completedLessonCount

Remove the entire “Not Enough Learning Yet” modal and any associated early-returns.

Ensure clicking any normal challenge card immediately opens ChallengeGame.jsx without restrictions.

Do NOT change Boss Level logic:

Boss Level must remain locked unless level >= 8.

Keep the existing Boss Level UI lock variant exactly the same.

Clean up any old lesson-check logic inside challengeStore.js:

Remove or disable any functions that block challenge creation based on lesson progress.

Challenges must ALWAYS be allowed to start, except Boss Level which must follow level >= 8.

Do NOT change any other challenge functionality.

2. Global Events Premium Lock

Update GlobalEvents.jsx and eventsStore.js so that:

Global Events remain VISIBLE but LOCKED for non-premium users.

Use the app’s existing “locked” UI (do not redesign it).

Only premium users may attempt to enter events.

Add the following rules:

If user is NOT premium:
→ clicking an event card shows the existing locked/upgrade UI (use the already-present UI code).

If user IS premium:
→ clicking an event card checks Ramadan logic.

Ramadan logic (already implemented by the user):
✔ If not Ramadan yet → show “Coming Ramadan”
✔ If Ramadan active → allow event entry

Do NOT modify the Ramadan system — keep the user’s existing code.

3. Cleanup and Cross-Check

Ensure Challenge.jsx and GlobalEvents.jsx no longer contain blockers except:
✔ Boss Level lock (level < 8)
✔ Global Events Premium lock
✔ Ramadan lock inside events

Ensure no leftover lesson-based restrictions remain in:

Challenge.jsx

ChallengeGame.jsx

challengeStore.js

After applying the changes, print a summary:

Which checks were removed

Confirmation that Challenges always unlock (except Boss Level)

Confirmation that Global Events remain visible but premium-locked

Confirmation that Ramadan “Coming Soon” behaviour stays unchanged

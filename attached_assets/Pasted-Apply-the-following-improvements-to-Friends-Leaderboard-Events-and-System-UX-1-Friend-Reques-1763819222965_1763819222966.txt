Apply the following improvements to Friends, Leaderboard, Events, and System UX:

1. Friend Request Badge:
   - Fix squashed badge for friend requests.
   - Ensure proper padding, border-radius, and visibility for any 1–3 digit numbers.

2. Friend Name Alignment:
   - In FriendsTab and LeaderboardTab components, ensure usernames align cleanly:
       • left-aligned text
       • avatar + username spacing consistent
       • no clipping or overflow
       • responsive for long names

3. Add USER to Friends Leaderboard:
   - Ensure the logged-in user ALWAYS appears in the Friends Leaderboard list.
   - Place the user in correct rank position based on XP.
   - Make sure avatar, XP, and level reflect the centralized progress store.

4. Avatar Consistency:
   - Make sure the user’s chosen avatar appears consistently across:
       • Friends list
       • Leaderboard
       • Global Events
       • Challenges
       • Any profile display
   - Remove any fallback or random avatar logic.

5. Global Events Icon Fix:
   - Replace the incorrect white circular fallback icon with the correct world-globe icon.
   - Ensure both:
       • the Challenges page
       • the Global Events page
     use the exact SAME icon component or asset.

6. Add Vibration/Haptic Feedback Toggle:
   - Create a vibration toggle in settings (default ON).
   - Create a small hook/function using navigator.vibrate:
         vibrate(ms) { if (vibrationEnabled) navigator.vibrate(ms); }
   - Trigger vibration on:
         • correct quiz answers
         • XP gain
         • challenge wins
         • boss hits
   - Respect the toggle (ON = vibrate, OFF = silent).

7. Add Offline Mode Detection:
   - Detect if the device loses internet (navigator.onLine).
   - When offline, show a styled banner or modal:
         “No connection — some features may not work offline.”
   - Hide the banner automatically when back online.

Do not modify XP, coins, analytics, or previously completed logic.
Keep all improvements consistent with the app’s theme.

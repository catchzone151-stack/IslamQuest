📘 REVISE TAB REQUIREMENTS

1) Core Purpose

Help users revise areas they are weak in by turning past mistakes into learning.

2) Main Feature — “Review Mistakes”

Collect every question the user has ever got WRONG from:
• lesson quizzes
• Daily Quest
• challenges

Avoid duplicates: only store unique questions.

Stored format (Supabase-ready):


{ question, options, answer, sourcePathId, lessonId, lastSeen }

Show them as infinite revision MCQs, shuffled.


3) Revision Session Logic

Each session = 10 questions pulled randomly from the weak-question pool.

If the pool has less than 10 → use all.

No timer.

After each question: instant correctness feedback (green/red highlight).

At the end:

show score

if user answers a previously wrong question correctly → remove it from weak pool

if user gets one wrong again → refresh its lastSeen timestamp


Small rewards (to prevent farming):

Correct: +4 XP

Perfect score bonus: +10 XP



4) Second Feature — “Smart Revision”

(Adds value beyond mistakes)

Identify the user’s weakest learning path (lowest accuracy).

Create a custom 8-question revision pack from that path only.

These questions do NOT need to be previous mistakes—just challenging, high-value ones.

Rewards:

+25 XP

+10 coins



5) UI/UX Requirements

Two big gold/navy cards:

1. “Review Mistakes”


2. “Smart Revision”



Use existing theme (navy, gold, rounded, glow).

Place Zayd mascot on the top-right corner of the page.

Use the same quiz engine UI so it feels consistent.

Add small info lines under each card like:

“Fix mistakes from past lessons.”

“Revise your weakest topics intelligently.”



6) Technical Architecture (Supabase-ready)

Keep everything local for now, but:

Use helper functions:
saveWrongQuestion, getWeakPool, removeIfMastered, getWeakestPath, etc.

All stored objects must use ISO dates.

Structure data so migration to Supabase later is trivial.

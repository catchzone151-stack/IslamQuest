FINAL REPLIT PROMPT — “Foundations of Islam” (Path ID: 2)

You are updating the file foundationsLessons.js and its matching quiz file.
Do not modify or affect any other files, paths, or logic.

🔹 GOAL

Generate a complete, polished Foundations of Islam learning path (path ID: 2).
It must follow the same style, UX, structure, and behaviour as the existing Names of Allah learning path.

🔸 LESSON STRUCTURE

For each of the 17 lessons:

Include 4 short paragraphs, each 80–100 words (≈320–400 words total per lesson).

Use authentic sources only: Qur’an and Sahih Hadith (Bukhari & Muslim).

Insert 1 evidence (ayah or hadith) in Arabic and English translation per lesson.

Keep language child-friendly, suitable for ages 10+ — clear, simple, and uplifting.

The lesson content must directly match its quiz (no mismatched topics).

Tone: warm, encouraging, clear — like a teacher guiding young students in faith.

🔸 QUIZ STRUCTURE

For each lesson, generate a matching quiz:

Exactly 4 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) per lesson.

Each quiz tests only that lesson’s material.

4 answer options per question; correct answer not always first.

Balanced difficulty (moderate, educational, enjoyable).

No trick questions; all factual and age-appropriate.

Keep reward modal logic unchanged — same design, same functionality.

The “Continue” button after each quiz must stay working exactly as it currently does.

🔸 VISUAL ADJUSTMENTS

Apply layout changes only to this path:

Remove all subheadings under lesson titles
(e.g. Keep “Belief in Allah”, remove “Knowing and affirming…”).

Reposition gold section headers (Five Pillars of Islam, Six Pillars of Faith, Living Islam):

Move slightly to the left of the path line, before the first related node.

Keep gold colour, font size, and weight — just adjust alignment.

Ensure layout is fully responsive across devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Full Replit Prompt – Foundations of Islam Path

Please finalise the Foundations of Islam learning path (path ID: 2) with the following requirements:

🕌 1. Lesson & Quiz Content

Each of the 17 lessons must have 4 short, simplified paragraphs (about 80–100 words total per lesson).

Lessons should draw only from the Qur’an and authentic hadith (Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim).

Include at least one ayah or hadith as supporting evidence in each lesson (Arabic + English translation).

Keep the tone educational, simple, and age-friendly (suitable for children from age 10+).

Every lesson must teach exactly what the quiz tests — the quiz questions should match that lesson’s content, not any other topic.

Each quiz should have 4 multiple-choice questions, clear and relevant, not too easy or obvious.

Continue using the same reward modal (no design or functional changes).

The “Continue” button after completing a quiz must remain functional and consistent.

Do not modify or generate quizzes or lessons for any other learning paths.

🎨 2. Visual and Layout Adjustments

Remove all lesson subheadings (secondary lines under the main lesson title).
Example: keep “Belief in Allah” only, remove “Knowing and affirming Allah’s Oneness”.

Reposition the gold section headings (e.g. Five Pillars of Islam, Six Pillars of Faith, Living Islam):
move them slightly to the left of the central vertical line so they appear neatly aligned beside the path, not overlapping the connector line.

Maintain their gold colour, font size, and weight, just change positioning.

Ensure layout remains responsive on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Apply these layout changes only to the Foundations of Islam path.

🟢 Do not alter:

Navigation, progress logic, reward system, or animations.

Any other paths, data, or files outside of foundationsLessons.js and its matching quiz file.

The result should match the Names of Allah path quality and behaviour but with these specific design and content adjustments.

REPLIT PROMPT — Foundations of Islam Path (Final Version)

Generate or verify complete lessons and quizzes for the learning path “Foundations of Islam” in my IslamQuest app.

⚠️ Follow these rules exactly and make no assumptions:

📁 Files to use only:

/src/data/lessons/foundationsLessons.js

/src/data/quizzes/foundations.json

Do not modify any other learning path, modal, or UI file.

📘 Curriculum structure:

There must be 17 lessons total, divided into 3 themed sections.
Each lesson must include:

id (1–17)

title

meaning (short 1–2 line summary)

content (lesson body; around 150–200 words, concise and child-friendly)

Section 1 — The Five Pillars of Islam (Lessons 1–5)

Shahadah – The Declaration of Faith

Salah – The Connection to Allah

Zakah – Purifying Wealth

Sawm – Fasting for Allah Alone

Hajj – The Journey of Unity

Section 2 — The Six Pillars of Belief (Īmān) (Lessons 6–11)

Belief in Allah

Belief in Angels

Belief in the Revealed Books

Belief in the Prophets

Belief in the Last Day

Belief in Divine Decree (Qadr)

Section 3 — Living Islam (Lessons 12–17)

Adab – Good Manners in Islam

Dua – Speaking to Allah

Brotherhood – The Muslim Ummah

🧠 Quiz generation rules:

For every lesson above, create one quiz in /src/data/quizzes/foundations.json.

Each quiz should contain 4 multiple-choice questions with 4 options and 1 correct answer.

Questions must come directly from that lesson’s teaching — no mixing between lessons.

Difficulty: medium (ages 10+), not too easy, not too hard, not obvious.

Mix up correct answer positions.

Focus on real understanding (meaning, wisdom, purpose, reflection).

📚 Source material (use only these):

Qur’an (direct ayat references when relevant)

Sahih al-Bukhari

Sahih Muslim
Do not use weak hadiths, stories, or tafsir paraphrasing.

🎨 App integration & logic:

Maintain the same modal design, gold theme, and reward logic as in “Names of Allah.”

Keep the MashaAllah reward modal identical — no new styling, text, or animations.

The Continue Learning button must still function exactly the same.

XP and coin rewards work the same way; no logic change.

Lessons must unlock sequentially after completing each quiz.

Add section headers inside the path display (non-clickable gold titles):

“The Five Pillars of Islam” before Lesson 1

“The Six Pillars of Belief (Īmān)” before Lesson 6

“Living Islam” before Lesson 12

✅ Final verification:

When done, output a short summary showing:

✅ Total lessons created (should be 17)

✅ Total quizzes created (should be 17)

✅ Confirmation all lesson–quiz IDs link correctly

✅ Confirmation reward modal and Continue logic were not modified

✅ Confirmation section headers appear in gold and match the theme

Only output this summary and do not include extra explanations or unrelated code.

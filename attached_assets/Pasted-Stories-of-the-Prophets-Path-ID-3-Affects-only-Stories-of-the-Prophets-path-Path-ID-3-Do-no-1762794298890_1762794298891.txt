Stories of the Prophets (Path ID: 3)

Affects only: Stories of the Prophets path (Path ID: 3).
Do not edit any other paths, store files, navigation, or reward systems.

📘 1. Lesson Generation

Use Qasas al-Anbiya as the primary source, referencing only Qur’an and authentic ahadith (Sahih Bukhari & Sahih Muslim).

Include 24 prophets, following their authentic chronological order in the book, ending with Prophet ‘Īsā (Jesus) — exclude Prophet Muhammad ﷺ (covered separately).

For each prophet:

Create 2 parts (Part 1 & Part 2), except for Prophet Idrīs — he has only 1 part.

Each part = 4 short paragraphs, ~30 words each (±10–15 words is fine).

Keep information accurate, simplified, and engaging for learners aged 10+.

Maintain chronological flow (no skipping or merging).

Each lesson must teach exactly what its quiz tests.

Tone: respectful, storytelling, simple English with light educational warmth.

Do not use Arabic text in lesson titles or path nodes (only English names).

🧠 2. Quizzes

For each lesson, create a matching quiz in src/data/quizzes/prophets.json.

Each quiz = 4 multiple-choice questions, 4 options (0–3), 1 correct answer (varied index).

Each quiz must:

Reflect the exact lesson content — no mismatched topics.

Stay moderate in difficulty (not obvious or tricky).

Be based only on Qur’an and Sahih ahadith.

Use English text only.

Maintain the same reward modal and “Continue” button behaviour (unchanged).

🎨 3. UI & Path Layout

Apply these adjustments only to this path (ID: 3):

Mascot: Use a new, fitting mascot (not reused from other paths) that suits the theme — e.g. a peaceful traveller or scholar.

Greeting: Replace “As-salāmu ʿalaykum…” with a motivational line, such as “Let’s journey through the lives of the Prophets 🌙”.

Subheadings: Remove all subheadings from lessons — keep only main prophet names (e.g. “Prophet Nūḥ (Noah)” not “The Ark of Patience”).

Gold Section Headings:

Add subtle category headers like Early Prophets, Prophets of Bani Isra’il, and Prophets before ‘Īsā (Jesus).

Shift them slightly left of the vertical connector line, not covering any nodes.

Keep their gold colour, size, and weight.

Ensure layout remains consistent and responsive (mobile/tablet/desktop).

🛑 Restrictions

Do not:

Touch other learning paths, quizzes, or lesson data.

Alter reward modal, progress logic, or navigation.

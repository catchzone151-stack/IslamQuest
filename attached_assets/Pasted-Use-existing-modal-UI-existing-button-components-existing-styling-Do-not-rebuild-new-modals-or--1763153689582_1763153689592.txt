Use existing modal UI + existing button components + existing styling.
Do not rebuild new modals or layouts unless required.


---

1. Payment Tiers

Individual Plan (£4.99)

Unlocks all lessons permanently

Applies across device

Stored in:

localStorage now

Supabase later



Family Plan (£18 total, 6 users)

Owner + 5 members

Each user has separate XP, coins, streak, avatar, nickname

All family users get everything unlocked



---

2. Upgrade Existing Premium Modal

Use the same modal component from Prompt 1 and upgrade its content:

Zayd mascot (keep existing animation)

Clean navy + gold styling (existing theme)

Buttons:

“Unlock All – £4.99”

“Family Access – £18 (6 users)”

“Restore Purchase”



Add simple benefit bullet points (use existing font styles):

Unlock all lessons

Lifetime access

No ads

Works across devices (Supabase-ready)


No layout changes except text/buttons.


---

3. Payment Functions (placeholders only)

Add the following functions but DO NOT integrate external services yet:

purchaseIndividual()
purchaseFamily()
restorePurchases()

On success:

premiumStatus = "individual" or "family"
familyPlanId = random generated string (if family)

Then re-run unlock logic to unlock everything immediately.


---

4. Family Plan UI (use existing screens)

Inside Profile → Premium section:

Show user’s current plan

If family plan:

Show a list UI using existing card/avatar components

Add placeholder buttons: Invite / Remove (UI only, no backend yet)


Keep styling consistent with the rest of the app



---

5. Supabase/RevenueCat Preparation

You MUST prepare the architecture:

All premium checks go through
premiumStatus & familyPlanId

All lesson unlocking must still depend on
isLessonUnlocked()


DO NOT integrate anything yet; just prepare.


---

6. Do NOT change:

Path content

XP/streak logic

Lesson maps

Daily quest

Revision

Challenges

Friends

Navigation

Theme


Only update premium-related behaviour.

🟩 PROMPT 2 SUMMARY

Upgrade premium modal → add payment tiers → add family UI → add placeholder purchase logic → connect to lock system → prepare for Supabase.

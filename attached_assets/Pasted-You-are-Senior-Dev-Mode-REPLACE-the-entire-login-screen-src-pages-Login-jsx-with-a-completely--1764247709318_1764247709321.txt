REPLACE the entire login screen (src/pages/Login.jsx) with a completely new UI that matches the IslamQuest theme.

REQUIREMENTS:

GENERAL STYLE:
- Full-screen centered layout
- Gradient background from deep navy (#030614) to indigo (#0a0f1e)
- White card container with rounded-2xl and soft shadow
- IslamQuest mascot above the card (use /src/assets/mascots/mascot_zayd_happy.webp)
- Title: "Welcome Back"
- Subtitle: "Sign in to continue your journey"

INPUT FIELDS:
- Two fields: Email and Password
- Use consistent styling with the rest of the app:
    rounded-xl
    background: var(--card-bg)
    border: 1px solid var(--border)
    text color: var(--text)
    placeholder: rgba(255,255,255,0.4)
    padding: 14px 16px
- Password field must have "show/hide" toggle icon.

BUTTON:
- “Sign In” button
- Purple/blue gradient: from var(--accent) to var(--accent-glow)
- Rounded-xl, height: 50px, full width
- Disabled state when loading

ERROR HANDLING:
- If login fails → show small red error text under fields:
    “Invalid email or password”
- Also shake the card slightly using a micro animation.

SUCCESS:
- After successful sign-in:
    → Immediately call useUserStore.getState().init()
    → Then navigate to "/home" (or "/" if that’s your main)

FORGOT PASSWORD LINK:
- Under the button: “Forgot Password?”
- Clicking it:
    - Shows a modal with an email input
    - User enters email → send Supabase password reset email:
        supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(email)
    - Show success toast:
        “A reset link has been sent to your email.”

SUPABASE LOGIC:
- Use supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password })
- If error → show error in UI
- If success → proceed to home

FILE CHANGES:

1. Replace src/pages/Login.jsx with:
    - New component: full layout, card, mascot, inputs, reset modal
    - Handles all logic above

2. Create new small component:
    src/components/ForgotPasswordModal.jsx
    - Contains email input + “Send reset link” button
    - On success close + toast message

3. Ensure the router still sends users to Login.jsx when not authenticated.

4. Keep all logic consistent with existing silentAuth + profile init.

END GOAL:
- Beautiful themed login screen
- Fully functional sign-in
- Forgot password flow working with Supabase
- Error/success UX polished
- No change to onboarding, lessons, or profile creation.

Apply all changes, rebuild, and ensure login works end-to-end.

## User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: React 18.2, Vite, JavaScript, React Router DOM v7.9, Framer Motion, Lucide React.
- **Design Pattern**: Component-based architecture with a mobile-first responsive design and a bottom navigation pattern.
- **State Management**: Local state using React hooks, global state with Zustand (`progressStore`, `userStore`, `titleStore`), and LocalStorage for persistence. Future migration to Supabase for cloud synchronization is planned.

### Styling Architecture
- **Approach**: CSS-in-JS using standard CSS files with custom properties for theming.
- **Theme System**: CSS variables define a consistent color palette: Navy (#0B1E2D) for backgrounds, Gold (#D4AF37) for accents, Emerald Green (#10B981) for success, and Light gray (#f3f4f6) for text.
- **Animation**: Built-in CSS keyframes (e.g., fadeIn) for page transitions.

### Data Architecture
- **Content Structure**: 14 predefined learning paths, each with lessons and quizzes. Examples include "Names of Allah," "Foundations of Islam," "Stories of Prophets," and "Life of Muhammad ﷺ." All paths are "available" by default.
- **Progression Model**: XP and coin rewards for lesson completion, streak system for daily engagement, and certificates for path completion.
- **Asset Management**: Centralized `assets.js` system for optimized WebP images (mascots, avatars, badges).

### Authentication & User Management
- **Provider**: Supabase Auth, integrated via `@supabase/auth-helpers-react` and `@supabase/supabase-js`.
- **Current Status**: Supabase client is configured, but full authentication flows are not yet implemented in components. LocalStorage serves as a temporary persistence layer.

### Build & Deployment
- **Development**: Vite dev server on port 5000 with host binding `0.0.0.0` for Replit compatibility.
- **Production**: `vite build` for optimized bundles and `vite preview` for testing.

## External Dependencies

### Third-Party Services
- **Supabase**: Used for authentication, database, and real-time subscriptions, configured with environment variables (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`).

### Core Libraries
- **UI & Animation**: `framer-motion`, `lucide-react`, `react-router-dom`.
- **Development Tools**: `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `typescript`.

### Asset Dependencies
- **Media Formats**: WebP images for all visual assets (mascots, avatars, badges, certificates) and SVG favicon. All assets are bundled locally.

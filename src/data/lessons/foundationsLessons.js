  // SECTION 1: The Five Pillars of Islam (Lessons 1-5)
  // ============================================================
  
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Shahadah – The Declaration of Faith",
    meaning: "The testimony that there is no god but Allah and Muhammad ﷺ is His messenger.",
    content: `The Shahadah is the foundation of Islam. It is the first pillar and the key to entering the faith. When a person says, "Ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah, wa ash-hadu anna Muhammadan rasulullah," they declare that Allah alone deserves worship and that Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is His final messenger.

This declaration is not just words—it must come from the heart with sincere belief. The Shahadah shapes how Muslims live their entire lives. It means rejecting false gods and committing to obey Allah's commands.

The Prophet ﷺ said, "Whoever says 'There is no god but Allah' and dies upon that will enter Paradise." (Sahih Bukhari)

Every act of worship in Islam begins with this belief. Without it, prayers, fasting, and charity have no meaning. The Shahadah reminds us daily that our purpose is to worship Allah alone and follow the example of His beloved Prophet ﷺ.`
  },

  {
    id: 2,
    title: "Salah – The Connection to Allah",
    meaning: "The five daily prayers that keep us connected to our Creator throughout the day.",
    content: `Salah is the second pillar of Islam and the most important act of worship after the Shahadah. Muslims pray five times a day: Fajr (dawn), Dhuhr (noon), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (sunset), and Isha (night). These prayers are a direct conversation with Allah.

The Prophet ﷺ said, "The first matter that the slave will be brought to account for on the Day of Judgment is the prayer. If it is sound, then the rest of his deeds will be sound." (Sunan an-Nasa'i)

Salah keeps our hearts clean and reminds us of our purpose. When we stand before Allah, we leave behind the distractions of life and focus only on Him. It teaches discipline, humility, and gratitude.

Allah commands us in the Qur'an: "Establish prayer for My remembrance." (Qur'an 20:14) Prayer is not a burden—it is a gift that brings peace to the heart and strength to face life's challenges.`
  },

  {
    id: 3,
    title: "Zakah – Purifying Wealth",
    meaning: "Giving a portion of our wealth to those in need to purify what we own.",
    content: `Zakah is the third pillar of Islam. It means giving 2.5% of our savings each year to help the poor, orphans, and those in need. Zakah is not charity—it is an obligation for those who have wealth.

Allah says in the Qur'an: "Take from their wealth a charity to purify them and sanctify them with it." (Qur'an 9:103)

Zakah teaches us that our wealth is a trust from Allah. We do not truly own anything—everything belongs to Him. By sharing what we have, we purify our hearts from greed and selfishness.

The Prophet ﷺ said, "Charity does not decrease wealth." (Sahih Muslim) This means that when we give for Allah's sake, He blesses what remains and multiplies our reward in the Hereafter.

Zakah also strengthens the Muslim community. It reduces poverty and reminds the wealthy to care for others. When we give Zakah, we acknowledge that Allah is the true Provider.`
  },

  {
    id: 4,
    title: "Sawm – Fasting for Allah Alone",
    meaning: "Abstaining from food, drink, and desires during Ramadan to gain closeness to Allah.",
    content: `Sawm, or fasting during the month of Ramadan, is the fourth pillar of Islam. From dawn until sunset, Muslims do not eat, drink, or engage in sinful behavior. Fasting is a training for the soul.

Allah says: "O you who believe, fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you, that you may become righteous." (Qur'an 2:183)

Fasting teaches self-control, patience, and empathy. When we feel hunger, we remember those who have little to eat every day. It also helps us break bad habits and focus on worship.

The Prophet ﷺ said, "Whoever fasts Ramadan with faith and seeking reward, his previous sins will be forgiven." (Sahih Bukhari)

Ramadan is a blessed month filled with Qur'an recitation, night prayers, and charity. Fasting is not just about avoiding food—it is about controlling anger, gossip, and evil thoughts. The goal is to leave Ramadan as a better person.`
  },

  {
    id: 5,
    title: "Hajj – The Journey of Unity",
    meaning: "The pilgrimage to Makkah that every able Muslim must perform once in their lifetime.",
    content: `Hajj is the fifth pillar of Islam. It is a journey to the sacred city of Makkah, where Muslims perform rituals established by Prophet Ibrahim عليه السلام and completed by Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.

Allah commands: "And proclaim to the people the Hajj; they will come to you on foot and on every lean camel from every distant pass." (Qur'an 22:27)

Hajj brings millions of Muslims together from every race, language, and country. Everyone wears simple white clothing, showing that we are all equal before Allah. Rich and poor stand side by side.

The Prophet ﷺ said, "Whoever performs Hajj and does not commit any obscenity or sin will return as pure as the day his mother gave birth to him." (Sahih Bukhari)

Hajj includes Tawaf (circling the Kaaba), standing at Arafat, and stoning the pillars that represent Shaytan. Every step is a reminder of submission to Allah and the struggle against evil. Hajj changes the heart forever.`

  // ============================================================
  // SECTION 2: The Six Pillars of Belief (Īmān) (Lessons 6-11)
  // ============================================================

  {
    id: 6,
    title: "Belief in Allah",
    meaning: "Knowing and affirming that Allah is the One and Only Creator, Lord, and God.",
    content: `Belief in Allah is the first and most important pillar of Īmān (faith). We believe that Allah is One, with no partners, sons, or daughters. He is the Creator of everything, and nothing exists except by His will.

Allah says: "Say, He is Allah, the One. Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent." (Qur'an 112:1-4)

We believe in Allah's beautiful names and perfect attributes. He is Ar-Rahman (the Most Merciful), Al-Hakim (the All-Wise), and Al-Qawiyy (the All-Powerful). He hears every word, sees every action, and knows what is in our hearts.

The Prophet ﷺ said, "Allah has ninety-nine names, and whoever memorizes them will enter Paradise." (Sahih Bukhari)

We worship Allah alone, without images or statues. We trust His plan even when life is hard. Belief in Allah gives meaning to our existence and fills the heart with peace and hope.`
  },

  {
    id: 7,
    title: "Belief in Angels",
    meaning: "Acknowledging the existence of angels created from light to worship and obey Allah.",
    content: `Angels are noble beings created by Allah from light. They do not eat, sleep, or disobey Allah. Each angel has a specific duty assigned by Allah.

The Qur'an says: "The Messenger has believed in what was revealed to him from his Lord, and so have the believers. All of them believe in Allah, His angels, His books, and His messengers." (Qur'an 2:285)

Some well-known angels include Jibril عليه السلام, who brought revelation to the prophets; Mikail عليه السلام, who controls rain and provision; Israfil عليه السلام, who will blow the trumpet on the Day of Judgment; and the Angel of Death, who takes souls when their time comes.

Two angels, Raqib and Atid, sit on our shoulders recording every good and bad deed. This reminds us to always be mindful of our actions.

Angels also surround those who remember Allah and seek knowledge. The Prophet ﷺ said, "The angels lower their wings for the seeker of knowledge." (Sunan Abi Dawud) Belief in angels strengthens our awareness that we are never truly alone.`
  },

  {
    id: 8,
    title: "Belief in the Revealed Books",
    meaning: "Believing that Allah sent down divine scriptures to guide humanity throughout history.",
    content: `Allah sent down books to guide people to the truth. The major revealed books are the Tawrah (Torah) given to Musa عليه السلام, the Zabur (Psalms) given to Dawud عليه السلام, the Injil (Gospel) given to Isa عليه السلام, and the Qur'an revealed to Muhammad ﷺ.

The Qur'an is the final and complete revelation. Allah says: "Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an, and indeed, We will be its guardian." (Qur'an 15:9)

Unlike previous scriptures, the Qur'an has been perfectly preserved in its original Arabic. Not a single letter has changed since it was revealed over 1,400 years ago.

The Prophet ﷺ said, "The best among you is the one who learns the Qur'an and teaches it." (Sahih Bukhari)

We believe the earlier books were true when they were revealed, but they were changed or lost over time. The Qur'an confirms what remains true in them and corrects what was altered. It is a guide for all people until the Day of Judgment.`
  },

  {
    id: 9,
    title: "Belief in the Prophets",
    meaning: "Believing that Allah chose special men to deliver His message to humanity.",
    content: `Allah sent prophets and messengers to every nation to teach people how to worship Him alone. Some were given books, and others were sent to remind people of earlier messages.

The Qur'an mentions 25 prophets by name, including Adam, Nuh, Ibrahim, Musa, Isa, and Muhammad عليهم السلام. The Prophet Muhammad ﷺ is the final messenger, and no prophet will come after him.

Allah says: "Muhammad is not the father of any of your men, but he is the Messenger of Allah and the seal of the prophets." (Qur'an 33:40)

All prophets taught the same core message: worship Allah alone and live a righteous life. They faced rejection, hardship, and persecution, but they never gave up.

The Prophet ﷺ said, "The prophets are brothers; their mothers are different, but their religion is one." (Sahih Bukhari)

We love and respect all prophets equally. We follow the example of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ because he is the final guide for humanity.`
  },

  {
    id: 10,
    title: "Belief in the Last Day",
    meaning: "Knowing with certainty that this life will end and we will be resurrected for judgment.",
    content: `The Last Day, also called the Day of Judgment, is when all humans will be brought back to life and judged by Allah for their deeds. This belief shapes how we live every moment.

Allah says: "Every soul will taste death, and you will only be given your full compensation on the Day of Resurrection." (Qur'an 3:185)

On that day, the scales will weigh our good and bad deeds. The books of our actions will be opened. Those who believed and did good will enter Paradise, and those who rejected Allah will face Hellfire.

The Prophet ﷺ said, "The clever person is the one who controls himself and works for what is after death." (Sunan at-Tirmidhi)

Belief in the Last Day stops us from doing wrong and motivates us to do good. It reminds us that this life is temporary and the Hereafter is eternal. Every choice we make today affects our tomorrow in the next life.`
  },

  {
    id: 11,
    title: "Belief in Divine Decree (Qadr)",
    meaning: "Trusting that everything happens according to Allah's knowledge, will, and perfect plan.",
    content: `Qadr means that Allah knows everything that has happened and everything that will happen. Nothing occurs without His knowledge and permission. He wrote everything in a book called Al-Lawh Al-Mahfudh (the Preserved Tablet) before creation began.

The Prophet ﷺ said, "Know that if the entire creation gathered to benefit you, they could not benefit you except with what Allah has written for you." (Sunan at-Tirmidhi)

Belief in Qadr does not mean we sit back and do nothing. We must make effort and trust Allah with the results. If something good happens, we thank Allah. If we face difficulty, we remain patient and trust His wisdom.

Allah says: "No disaster strikes except by permission of Allah. And whoever believes in Allah—He will guide his heart." (Qur'an 64:11)

Qadr brings peace to the heart. We do not despair when plans fail, nor do we become arrogant when we succeed. Everything is in Allah's hands, and His plan is always best.`

  // ============================================================
  // SECTION 3: Living Islam (Lessons 12-17)
  // ============================================================

  {
    id: 12,
    title: "Ihsan – Worship as if You See Him",
    meaning: "The highest level of faith: worshiping Allah as if you see Him, knowing that He sees you.",
    content: `Ihsan is the peak of faith. The Prophet ﷺ defined it beautifully: "Ihsan is to worship Allah as if you see Him, and if you cannot see Him, then know that He sees you." (Sahih Bukhari)

This means doing everything with excellence, sincerity, and awareness of Allah's presence. When we pray, we pray as if standing before Allah. When we speak, we speak as if He is listening. When we are alone, we remember that He is watching.

Ihsan transforms ordinary actions into acts of worship. Smiling at someone, helping a neighbor, or being honest in business all become forms of devotion when done for Allah's sake.

The Qur'an says: "Indeed, Allah is with those who are righteous and those who do good." (Qur'an 16:128)

A person of Ihsan does not pray only when others are watching. They guard their character in public and private. Ihsan is the goal every Muslim should aim for—living every moment with the awareness that Allah is near.`
  },

  {
    id: 13,
    title: "Tawbah – Returning to Allah",
    meaning: "Sincere repentance when we fall into sin, knowing that Allah is always ready to forgive.",
    content: `Tawbah means turning back to Allah after making a mistake. Every human sins, but the best sinners are those who repent. Allah loves those who return to Him with sincere hearts.

Allah says: "O you who have believed, repent to Allah with sincere repentance." (Qur'an 66:8)

True Tawbah has four conditions: stop the sin immediately, feel genuine regret, resolve never to return to it, and if the sin involved harming others, seek their forgiveness and make things right.

The Prophet ﷺ said, "All the children of Adam are sinners, but the best sinners are those who repent." (Sunan at-Tirmidhi)

No sin is too great for Allah to forgive—except dying while associating partners with Him. Even if someone has committed major sins for years, Allah's mercy is greater. He says: "Say, O My servants who have transgressed against themselves, do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed, Allah forgives all sins." (Qur'an 39:53)

Repentance purifies the soul and brings peace.`
  },

  {
    id: 14,
    title: "Adab – Good Manners in Islam",
    meaning: "Living with beautiful character and respect toward Allah, people, and all creation.",
    content: `Adab means good manners and proper behavior. Islam is not just about praying and fasting—it is about treating people with kindness, respect, and dignity. The Prophet ﷺ had the best character, and we are commanded to follow his example.

The Prophet ﷺ said, "The best among you are those who have the best manners and character." (Sahih Bukhari)

Good manners include speaking kindly, keeping promises, being honest, respecting parents, helping neighbors, and controlling anger. Even small actions matter—smiling, greeting others with "As-Salaamu Alaykum," and removing harm from the road are acts of worship.

Allah says: "And lower your wing in humility to the believers." (Qur'an 15:88)

Bad manners, like lying, backbiting, mocking others, or breaking promises, destroy faith. The Prophet ﷺ warned that a person may pray and fast, but if they harm others with their words or actions, their worship is incomplete.

Adab reflects the beauty of Islam. When we have good character, people are drawn to the faith.`
  },

  {
    id: 15,
    title: "Dua – Speaking to Allah",
    meaning: "Calling upon Allah directly with our needs, hopes, and gratitude in every situation.",
    content: `Dua is the act of calling upon Allah, asking for His help, guidance, and mercy. It is one of the most beloved acts of worship. Unlike prayer (Salah), which has specific words and movements, Dua can be made anytime, anywhere, and in any language.

Allah says: "And your Lord says, 'Call upon Me; I will respond to you.'" (Qur'an 40:60)

Dua shows our dependence on Allah. When we raise our hands and speak to Him, we acknowledge that He is the only One who can truly help us. Whether we need strength, forgiveness, success, or healing, we turn to Him first.

The Prophet ﷺ said, "Dua is the essence of worship." (Sunan at-Tirmidhi)

We should make Dua for ourselves, our families, and all Muslims. We should ask for both this life and the Hereafter. Allah hears every Dua, even if the answer comes in a different form or at a different time. Sometimes Allah gives us what we ask, sometimes He protects us from harm, and sometimes He saves the reward for us in Paradise.`
  },

  {
    id: 16,
    title: "Brotherhood – The Muslim Ummah",
    meaning: "The bond of faith that unites all Muslims as one family across the world.",
    content: `The Muslim Ummah is a global brotherhood and sisterhood united by faith in Allah and love for His Messenger ﷺ. Muslims may speak different languages, live in different countries, and have different cultures, but they are one family in Islam.

The Prophet ﷺ said, "The example of the believers in their affection, mercy, and compassion for one another is like a body. When one part of it suffers, the whole body responds with sleeplessness and fever." (Sahih Bukhari)

This means that when a Muslim anywhere in the world is in pain, we should feel their pain and help them. Brotherhood is shown through acts of kindness, charity, and sincere Dua.

Allah says: "The believers are but brothers, so make reconciliation between your brothers." (Qur'an 49:10)

Brotherhood also means correcting one another with love and advising toward good. It means forgiving mistakes, avoiding gossip, and standing together against injustice. A true Muslim loves for their brother or sister what they love for themselves.`
  },

  {
    id: 17,
    title: "The Balance – Faith in Action",
    meaning: "Living a complete Islamic life by balancing worship, character, knowledge, and service to others.",
    content: `Islam is a balanced way of life. It is not only about praying in the mosque or reading the Qur'an—it is about applying faith in every aspect of life. A complete Muslim balances worship, work, family, and community.

Allah says: "And seek, through that which Allah has given you, the home of the Hereafter; and do not forget your share of the world." (Qur'an 28:77)

This means we should strive for success in both this life and the next. We pray, but we also work hard. We fast, but we also care for our health. We seek knowledge, but we also serve others.

The Prophet ﷺ was the perfect example of balance. He worshiped Allah with devotion, led his community with wisdom, treated his family with kindness, and showed mercy to all creation.

Balance also means avoiding extremes. Islam is the middle path—not too strict, not too lenient. When we live with balance, our faith becomes strong, our hearts become content, and our actions reflect the beauty of Islam.`
